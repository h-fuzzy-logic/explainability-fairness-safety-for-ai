# Explainability, Fairness, and Safety for AI

ðŸ‘‹ Hello and Welcome!  

Iâ€™m sharing resources and ideas about ethical AI.    

My perspective is that of a technical consultant who works as a software engineer, data engineer, and cloud architect on analytics and development teams. 

Usually, the teams exist within siloehed enterprises and build amazing products and platforms. But there is an element of mystery to their creations. Mystery about HOW the AI creations and integrations actually work.  

That is why explainability, fairness, and safety are such important topics. And yet it is hard for teams to get started.  

Explaining why it matters is hard. Convincing your team leader, your team, and/or your manager to spend more time (and MONEY) on explainability, fairness, and safety is challenging. Especially when no one is really complaining. 

So with all this in mind, Iâ€™m here sharing what Iâ€™m learning about explainability, fairness, and safety related to Artifical Intelligence.
