## ITI-GEN: Inclusive Text-to-Image Generation

ITI-GEN is an Inclusive text-to-image generator that solves the problem of biased image generation that doesn't reflect the diversity you’d expect in 2024. For example, if you prompt with “generate an image of a computer scientist” and you get images that all look the same (same gender, same skin tone, all wearing glasses), then ITI-GEN can generate more diverse images. Code, data, and research paper all available at https://czhang0528.github.io/iti-gen

## SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
SHAP explains the outputs of machine learning models. Use it to explain your models that are trained on tabular, textual, or image data. More information at https://github.com/shap/shap.
