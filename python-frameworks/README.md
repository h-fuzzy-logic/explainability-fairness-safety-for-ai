## ITI-GEN: Inclusive Text-to-Image Generation

ITI-GEN is an Inclusive text-to-image generator that solves the problem of biased image generation that doesn't reflect the diversity you’d expect in 2024. For example, if you prompt with “generate an image of a computer scientist” and you get images that all look the same (same gender, same skin tone, all wearing glasses), then ITI-GEN can generate more diverse images. Code, data, and research paper all available at https://czhang0528.github.io/iti-gen

## Opik (created by Comet)

There is a free introductory course “LLM Evaluation with Opik” available in April 2025 at https://www.comet.com/site/llm-course/. It has plenty of code examples showing how to evaluate a chatbot that answers questions about a restaurant menu. 

The course covers several topics relevant for a development team working on a chatbot application. 

For a team will struggling with: 
1) predicting how an LLM will respond to user questions
-OR-
2) logging and monitoring the actual responses in a production environment

Opik helps you test that a relevant and factual answer will be returned without hallucinations. And it also allows you to monitor real-time responses with the same metrics.

For the restaurant chatbot example, Opik gives your team confidence about how an LLM will answer questions like:
* Do you have any gluten free desserts
* What is the best appetizer on the menu
